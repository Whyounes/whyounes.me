Earlier this week, a developer [asked the Rails subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/2qq1co/interview_question_need_to_make_it_more_rubyesque/) to help refactor some code they had written for an interview.

It was a nice and small little problem so I ported the original solution to PHP and took a stab at refactoring it in screencast format.

Check it out and let me know what you think!
