This weekend I had the opportunity to give two talks at the TrueNorthPHP conference in Toronto. I gave my ["TDD: The Good Parts"](/2014/11/03/tdd-the-good-parts) talk on the first day, but also a new talk on the second day about building framework agnostic packages, based on [this blog post](/2014/01/05/decoupling-your-packages-from-your-framework).
