After [my presentation at Laracon this year](/2015/09/02/chasing-perfect-at-laracon-eu), a lot of people asked me how I'd take that same polymorphic approach when the objects would have to be retrieved from the database.

This screencast covers how I'd approach implementing the same idea in a real Laravel application with Eloquent, by using polymorphic relationships and delegation to accomplish the same thing without having to resort to any nasty conditionals.
