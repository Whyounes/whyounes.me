I have this dream where one day I'll be able to cancel my talk/text plan and just pay $50/month for 10gb of data and get by perfectly fine.

I want to be able to receive a message on my phone, start a conversation, and hop onto my laptop when I get home and continue that conversation on a desktop client totally seamlessly. I want to be able to invite other people into that conversation sometimes, too.

I want to be able to go down into the basement and get a workout in, while still being able to receive phone calls without cell reception, because my calls come in over WiFi instead of through my carrier.

We're getting so damn close to this being a reality, but at the moment there is at least one deal breaking flaw with all of the options I've tried.

## The Competition

### Google Hangouts

Google Hangouts is pretty solid, but the desktop client is brutal. You can't cmd+tab to it like any of your other open applications, which drives me insane. Google also decided to prevent awesome third party clients like Flamingo from being able to use the group chat functionality. Great.

### Skype

Can't start group chats from the mobile client. Have to pay to do group video conferences. No thanks.

### What's App

Great chat client, does group messaging really well too. No desktop client though and can't do voice/video, so it's not a full solution.

### BBM

Every group message I receive though shows up on my home screen and then doesn't exist in the actual app. Doesn't do voice or video. Also totally awkward to navigate. I'll pass.

### iMessage/FaceTime

Honestly iMessage and FaceTime are basically perfect, especially since the addition of FaceTime Audio in iOS 7. I love that I don't even notice iMessage exists, it just integrates perfectly seamlessly with the existing messaging system. Same with FaceTime, can make calls directly from my contact list just like a regular phone call without having to go through any extra steps. The obvious issue here is that all this stuff is iOS only, and most of the damn people I want to talk to are on Android devices.

## Verdict

iMessage/FaceTime is *by far* the most complete and enjoyable to use of the bunch. Seamless integration, great lightweight desktop client, does group chatting totally fine from any device, offers voice and video, etc. Locking it to iOS totally takes it out of the running though, which is a real heart breaker.

Hangouts is clearly the next best thing, and I really hope it can be improved over time because there's a lot of potential there. If Google can make the desktop client actually usable, it would basically be there.

Cell contract is up next summer, so I'm hoping by then things have improved enough that I can give this data-only thing a serious try. I think we'd already be there if it wasn't for the greedy carriers trying to hold back technological advancement and positive change like they've been doing with cable for the past 10 years. 

Fingers crossed Hangouts + a Google Voice phone number will actually be a feasible alternative to standard talk/text plans in 6 months.
