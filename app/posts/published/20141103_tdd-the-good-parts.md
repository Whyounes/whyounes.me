In September I was lucky enough to be able to travel to [Laracon EU](http://laracon.eu/2014/) in Amsterdam and give a talk about TDD on community day. The response was great and since then a lot of people have asked me for video of the presentation.

Last week I had the opportunity to give the talk again at the [Laravel Toronto](http://www.meetup.com/Laravel-Toronto/) user group and was able to put together this video.

If you've ever struggled with TDD and felt like it was too much to learn at one time, or that it was forcing you to write code that you didn't like, check out the video for some *(hopefully)* refreshing ideas on an important subject in modern web development.
